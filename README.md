I don't know how to properly write README files, bear with me

the file order goes as follows :: 

MakingChange - main method and creates main jframe && Jpanel layout

RegisterPanel - makes the input panel layout, creates logic obj, creates and sends data to PursePanel

PursePanel - takes in logic obj and uses it to display images

Register - logic driver class

Purse - main logic class 

Denomination - holds money info
