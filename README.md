* the strategies i used are factory and builder strategies
* use a factory or component pattern to break up purse into cash and coins
* use a builder to build the purse
* --- * do something like (set 10, set 20, set 40, set .25, set .50, etc)
* --- * use the factory to build based off of the builder
